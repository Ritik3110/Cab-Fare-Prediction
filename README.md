# Ride Fare Prediction with Weather Data

## Project Overview

This project combines two datasets — ride details and weather information — by merging them based on source and destination locations. After merging, the data undergoes cleaning and encoding of categorical features to prepare it for modeling.

Using this enriched dataset, a **linear regression model** is developed to predict ride fares. The model leverages location, destination, and weather features to understand how these factors influence pricing.

## Key Features

- Data merging based on source and destination  
- Data cleaning and encoding of categorical variables  
- Feature engineering for improved model performance  
- Linear regression modeling and evaluation  

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ritik3110/Cab-Fare-Prediction
````

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd your-repo
   ```
3. Create and activate a Python virtual environment:

   * On Windows:

     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   * On macOS/Linux:

     ```bash
     python3 -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
4. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

* Open and run the Jupyter notebook `predict.ipynb` to explore the data, train, and evaluate the linear regression model.
* Alternatively, run any Python scripts included in the repository for data preprocessing and model training.
